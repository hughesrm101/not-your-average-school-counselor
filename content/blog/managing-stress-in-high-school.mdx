## Crisis Intervention

When stress becomes overwhelming, students may need immediate support:

1. **Assess the situation** - Is the student in immediate danger?
2. **Provide emotional support** - Listen without judgment
3. **Connect with resources** - Refer to appropriate services
4. **Follow up** - Check in regularly
5. **Document** - Keep appropriate records

Remember, stress is a normal part of life, but when it becomes overwhelming, students need support and tools to manage it effectively.
