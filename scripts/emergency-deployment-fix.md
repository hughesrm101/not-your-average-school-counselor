# ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT FIX

## THE PROBLEM
AWS Amplify webhook is broken - not detecting Git pushes since October 6th, 2025.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS

### Option 1: Manual Deployment Trigger (FASTEST)
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
2. Find your app: **nyasc-platform**
3. Click on it
4. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
5. Look for **"Redeploy this version"** or **"Start new deployment"** button
6. Click it to manually trigger deployment
7. Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment to complete

### Option 2: Fix Webhook Connection
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
2. Find your app: **nyasc-platform**
3. Click on it
4. Go to **"App Settings"** â†’ **"General"**
5. Check **"Repository"** connection
6. If broken, click **"Disconnect"** then **"Connect"** again
7. Make sure webhook is enabled

### Option 3: Recreate Amplify App (NUCLEAR OPTION)
If nothing else works:
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
2. Click **"New app"** â†’ **"Host web app"**
3. Connect to your GitHub repository: `hughesrm101/not-your-average-school-counselor`
4. Select branch: `main`
5. Use the same build settings from your current `amplify.yml`

## WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER FIX
Once deployment works, you should see:
- âœ… **Green box** with "âœ… WEBHOOK TEST"
- âœ… **"Hey friend! ðŸ’™"** (authentic, caring tone)
- âœ… **All links working** (shop, blog, about, merch)
- âœ… **Caring, empathetic content throughout**

## VERIFICATION
Visit: https://nyasc.co
Look for the green test box - if you see it, the deployment is working!

## NEXT STEPS
1. Try Option 1 first (manual trigger)
2. If that works, we can fix the webhook later
3. If that doesn't work, try Option 2 (reconnect repository)
4. If still broken, Option 3 (recreate app)

The manual deployment trigger should definitely work and show you the authentic, caring content!
